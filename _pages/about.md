I am a machine learning engineer at [Factored.ai](https://www.factored.ai), a company part of Andrew Ng's AI Fund ecosystem. During my time in the industry, I have developed deep learning applications,specially in computer vision, that overcome common problems (such as data quality and lack of computational power) faced outside the big techs companies. The techniques and specifics of each one of the aforementioned projects can be found in my [CV](assets/pdf/CV.pdf). I'm excited about Machine learning and Statistics solutions for social applications and model interpretability, specially those applied to health and wellness. I hold a B.Sc. and a M.Sc., both in Mathematics from Universidad de Los Andes (2017, 2018).
