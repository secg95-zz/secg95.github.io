I am a machine learning engineer at [Factored.ai](https://www.factored.ai), a company part of Andrew Ng's AI Fund ecosystem. During my time in the industry I have developed deep learning applications (specially in computer vision). that leverages common problems  such as, data qulaity, noise in the labels and Computaionla power, a more complete description of the projects i have been involved togeteher with the technologies reuired can be found in my [CV](assets/pdf/CV.pdf). I'm excited about Machine learning and Statistics solutions for data interpretability, alternative data and social applications, specially those applied to Health and wellness. I hold a B.Sc. and a M.Sc., both in Mathematics from Universidad de Los Andes (2017, 2018).
