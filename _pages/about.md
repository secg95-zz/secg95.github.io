I am a machine learning engineer at [Factored.ai](https://www.factored.ai), a company part of Andrew Ng's AI Fund ecosystem. During my time in the industry I have developed deep learning applications (specially in computer vision). that leverages common problems  such as, data qulaity, noise in the labels and Computaionla power, a more complete description of the projects i have been involved togeteher with the technologies reuired can be found in my CV. I'm excited about Machine learning and Statistics solutions for data interpretability, alternative data and social applications, specially those applied to Health and wellness. I hold a B.Sc. and a M.Sc., both in Mathematics from Universidad de Los Andes (2017, 2018).

Myresearch interest lies in the intersection of machine learning, statistics and publicpolicy, especially health. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
